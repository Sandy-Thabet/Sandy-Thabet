### Hi, I’m Sandy!

Hello! I'm **Sandy**, a passionate backend developer with a strong foundation in Node.js, Express, and Prisma. My journey in software development began with a curiosity about how things work behind the scenes in the digital world, leading me to dive deep into the world of backend technologies. Over the years, I've honed my skills in building robust, scalable, and efficient server-side applications.

Currently, I'm working on a freelance project where I get to apply my skills to solve real-world problems and deliver impactful solutions to clients. My most recent accomplishment is the launch of my first project, an E-Commerce API, which I built from the ground up using Node.js and Express.js. This project was a significant milestone in my career, showcasing my ability to manage product listings, user accounts, order processing, and more, all while ensuring seamless integration of payment systems.

In addition to my technical skills, I have a keen interest in working with relational databases and ORM frameworks like Prisma. I enjoy the challenge of designing data models, optimizing queries, and ensuring data consistency across applications. My experience with JWT authentication and token management has also equipped me with the tools needed to build secure and reliable systems.

Outside of coding, I'm always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies. Whether it's diving into a new programming language, exploring the latest in web development, or experimenting with cloud services, I believe in continuous learning and growth.

When I'm not coding, you might find me enjoying a good book, exploring nature, or listening to my favorite music by Basant Dienar.

Thank you for visiting my Github Profile! I look forward to connecting and exploring new opportunities together.
